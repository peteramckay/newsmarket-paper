# News Exchange Specification (Draft)

This a specification for a better exchange for digital journalism, incorporating features from the Dispatch blockchain. 

This repo will eventually include markdown, ODT, PDF, and HTML versions of the document, as well as a few related images.

For now, as the document is still in early draft form, the markdown version is the one I primarily use to make updates as I go. For the very latest tweaks, I'd recommend taking a look at that one.

Cheers,
