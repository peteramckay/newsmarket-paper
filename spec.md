# News Exchange Specification (Draft)

### Introduction

To be strictly accurate, the news business isn’t facing "a crisis" these days. It has <em>crises</em>, plural.

Start with sagging revenues and layoffs at major news organizations due to disruption of their traditional advertising model by Google and Facebook. Then there’s waning public trust in the press, some of it driven by the easy spread of propaganda and misinformation online. And, of course, there’s always the parlor game of critiquing the quality of daily coverage in general. Are journalists flat-out missing certain stories? Could they cover some subjects more thoroughly? Are they biased regarding certain sources or topics? And so on.

This document represents an attempt at solving the economic piece of this mess, assuming that it in particular is the root of most of the other issues. Just solve the problem of making journalism commercially viable again, and the whole ecosystem improves significantly in all sorts of ways. 

Our proposed vehicle for doing this is a distributed news exchange built using the Dispatch crypto token. This exchange should have the following features: 

- <strong>Uses blockchain for managing user identity and payment transfer.</strong> including micro increments if necessary.
- <strong>Runs news organizations' business logic off-blockchain.</strong> This is accomplished via Dispatch's Distributed Artifact Network. There may be off-the-shelf modules for implementation of, say, a paywall or an ad model or to sell event tickets.
- <strong>Works for a range of users and news providers.</strong> 

What's out of scope: 

- Hosting news content.
- Managing user comments or feedback.
- Managing newsroom governance.

- Journalism is in a multi-business model world to stay.

- The solution must work for the widest range of providers possible out of the box. 

- Allow users to log in to their favorite news sites easily. The need to manage relationships with users is crucial, even if the content is free.
