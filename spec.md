# News Exchange Specification (Draft)

### Introduction

To be strictly accurate, the news business isn’t facing "a crisis" these days. It has <em>crises</em>, plural.

Start with sagging revenues and layoffs at major news organizations due to disruption of their traditional advertising model by Google and Facebook. Then there’s waning public trust in the press, some of it driven by the easy spread of propaganda and misinformation online. And, of course, there’s always the parlor game of critiquing the quality of daily coverage in general. Are journalists flat-out missing certain stories? Could they cover some subjects more thoroughly? Are they biased regarding certain sources or topics? And so on.

This document represents an attempt at solving the economic piece of this mess, assuming that it in particular is the root of most of the other issues. Just solve the problem of making journalism commercially viable again, and the whole ecosystem improves significantly in all sorts of ways. 

Our proposed vehicle for doing this is a distributed news exchange built using the Dispatch crypto token. This exchange should have the following features: 

- <strong>Uses blockchain for managing user identity and payment transfer.</strong> including micro increments if necessary.
- <strong>Runs news organizations' business logic off-blockchain.</strong> This is accomplished via Dispatch's Distributed Artifact Network. There may be off-the-shelf modules for implementation of, say, a paywall or an ad model or to sell event tickets.
- <strong>Works for a range of users and news providers.</strong> 

What's out of scope: 

- Hosting news content.
- Managing user comments or feedback.
- Managing newsroom governance.

### Why journalism must function commercially

$1.50...
$50 in Europe...
Even the higher spend doesn't get much in terms of...

((NOTES))


- Journalism is in a multi-business model world to stay.

- The solution must work for the widest range of providers possible out of the box. 

- Allow users to log in to their favorite news sites easily. The need to manage relationships with users is crucial, even if the content is free.

((Distinguish from Civil))


### TKTKTK

- Transaction times should be orders of magnitude faster on this proposed system than on Civil. While more testing will be necessary to specify, "10x Rule"... It could be hundreds of times faster, due two factors. First, we're limiting the scope of overall functionality of the system. Second, we're moving a signficant chunk of the remaining functionality to the off-chain DAN, versus Civil's implementation of a "purer" blockchain solution.

### Issues

- For some startup news organizations in particular, Civil's use of DAO structures may be valuable. As these organizations, by definition, need to build editorial credibility, the DAO over time may prove to be a useful feature for them. But for larger providers with recognized "brands" among consumers, the DAO structure will likely be just the opposite -- a needless incumberance to blockchain adoption. Similarly, new entrants may be interested and/or fully able to build credibility in other ways. Quartz, TK, and TK, for instance, have had no problem building credibility in recent years, for instance, even without taking votes of their users via the blockchain.
