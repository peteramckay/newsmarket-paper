### Introduction

To be strictly accurate, the news business isn’t facing "a crisis" these days. It confronts <em>crises</em>, plural.

Start with sagging revenues and layoffs at major news organizations due to disruption of the industry's traditional advertising model by Google and Facebook. Then there's waning public trust in the press, some of it driven by the easy spread of propaganda and misinformation online. And, of course, there's always the parlor game of critiquing the quality of daily coverage. Are journalists flat-out missing certain stories? Could they cover some subjects more thoroughly? Are they biased regarding certain sources or topics? And so on.

This document focuses keenly on solving the economic piece of the puzzle in particular, under the assumption that part is the root of most of the rest. Just make journalism commercially viable again, and the whole ecosystem improves in all sorts of ways. 

While that might seem an obvious truism to some, it has been flagrantly ignored in the design and execution of most news-industry innovation efforts to date. Such projects tend to focus on <em>newsgathering</em> and <em>storytelling</em> as the functions of news organizations that need better digital tools first. Then monetiztion per se tends to get short shrift, or else it's ceded altogther to third-party tech platforms that may or may not adequately cut publishers in on any resulting revenue.

In particular, Silicon Valley has effectively insinuated itself as a middleman in the daily relationship between publisher and news consumer. [TK] Above all, this document represents an attempt to <em>dis</em>intermediate that relationship, allow publishers and their audiences to relate more directly to one another again, and thus allow journalism to be better supported.

The vehicle proposed herein to accomplish that admittedly tall challenge is a distributed news exchange to be built using the Dispatch blockchain protocol. The exchange should have the following features: 

- <strong>Manages user identity and payment transfer via the blockchain.</strong> Users create an identity that persists across multiple news sites and allows them to pay each publisher according to its particular business model, including micropayments if necessary.
- <strong>Runs publishers' business logic off-blockchain.</strong> This will be accomplished via Dispatch's Distributed Artifact Network. The exchange should also be flexible to support multiple approaches for publishers to make money. There may be off-the-shelf DAN modules for implementation of, say, a publisher paywall or an advertising model or to sell event tickets. 
- <strong>Participants can buy and sell exchange tokens amongst themselves</strong>.
- <strong>Works for a range of users and news providers.</strong> This system is designed to be useful on Day One for incumbent publishers or new entrants, for digital-only shops or legacy publications, for organizations or individual freelancers. Using open-source software from this project, any publisher should be able to set up sign in, payments, and business logic to support their journalism.

In action, the exchange should look something like this:

It's also important to note what <em>not</em> in scope for the news exchange proposed herein. It doesn't include any features for: 

- Hosting news content.
- Managing user comments or feedback.
- Managing newsroom governance.

These functions are all left for news organizations to handle with their existing workflows and technical infrastructure. 




, as that differentiates it significantly from previous attempts at blockchain journalism solutions, particularly the Civil crypto token.



Dieter Rams: "Less, but better."



### Advantages

- Transaction times should be orders of magnitude faster on this proposed system than on Civil. While more testing will be necessary to specify, an implementation of the exchange as described herein should easily satisfy Larry Page's "10x Rule"... It could be hundreds of times faster, due two factors. First, we're limiting the scope of overall functionality of the system. Second, we're moving a signficant chunk of the remaining functionality to the off-chain DAN, versus Civil's implementation of a "purer" blockchain solution. 

- Flexibility. 

- Better user privacy.


### Issues

- For some startup news organizations in particular, Civil's use of DAO structures may be valuable. As these organizations, by definition, need to build editorial credibility, the DAO over time may prove to be a useful feature for them. But for larger providers with recognized "brands" among consumers, the DAO structure will likely be just the opposite -- a needless incumberance to blockchain adoption. Similarly, new entrants may be interested and/or fully able to build credibility in other ways. Quartz, TK, and TK, for instance, have had no problem building credibility in recent years, for instance, even without taking votes of their users via the blockchain.

- 2016 CBC study on funding for public broadcast: A 2016 study of 18 western nations for Canadian public broadcasting showed that the state funding leader was Norway, at more than $134 per person. France spends less than half that, at $54 per capita. At less than a fourth of what Norway pays, Italy spends $28, while our neighbors to the north commit $21. How much does the U.S. spend? Around $2 per person per year – lowest of all countries studied. In fact, the U.S. spent less than 4 percent of the average of the 18 Western nations studied.

- Europe, which has better public funding for media, isn't immune to misninformation either. See https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/11/23/the-eu-moves-to-counter-russian-disinformation-campaign-populism/




- Nieman article on questionable nonprofit scaling: http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/11/what-does-sustainability-look-like-in-nonprofit-journalism/




Public funding levels...

$1.50...
$50 in Europe...

Even the higher spend doesn't get much in terms of...

- Journalism is in a multi-business model world to stay.

- Allow users to log in to their favorite news sites easily. The need to manage relationships with users is crucial, even if the content is free.
