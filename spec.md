## Introduction

To be strictly accurate, the news business isn’t facing "a crisis" these days. It has crises, plural.

Start with sagging revenues and layoffs at major organizations due to the disruption of their traditional advertising model by Google and Facebook. Then there’s waning public trust in the press, some of it driven by the easy spread of propaganda online. And, of course, there’s always the parlor game of critiquing the quality of daily coverage in general — whether journalists are flat-out missing certain stories, or could cover some more thoroughly, whether they’re biased against certain sources or topics, and so on.

This document represents an attempt at solving journalism's economic problems in particular, based on the premise that they are the true root of most of the professon's other problems. Pretty much everything else improves if journalism is properly resourced and rewarded economically.

The placement of strictly editorial matters outside of scope is, above all, what differentiates this 

The news exchange should:

- Support different kinds of news providers, including existing orgs, new entrants, and individual creators.
- Support multiple business models. From Gutenberg up to the 1990s, ads dominated 
- Allow users to log in to their favorite news sites easily. The need to manage relationships with users is crucial, even if the content is free.

Best architechture is probably to use blockchain for identity and payments, including micropayments if necessary. Business logic should be stored off-chain but linked back to it as an artifact.
